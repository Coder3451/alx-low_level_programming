# 0x05. Pointers, Arrays and Strings

Welcome to the `0x05-pointers_arrays_strings` directory! This directory is part of the `alx-low_level_programming` repository. Here, we delve into the foundational concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. This README provides an overview of the directory, its contents, and how to get started.

## Overview

In this directory, you will find several tasks that focus on understanding and utilizing pointers, arrays, and strings in C. These concepts are fundamental for managing memory and handling data efficiently in C programming.

## Project Structure

The directory contains multiple C files and header files, each focusing on specific tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings. Below is the structure of the directory:
```sh
tree 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
```

## Requirements

- **Compiler:** GCC
- **C Standard:** C89 (with a few C99 features)
- **Development Environment:** Linux

## Usage

To compile and run any of the programs in this directory, use the `gcc` compiler followed by the name of the file you wish to compile. For example, to compile and run `0-reset_to_98.c`, you can use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantiic -std=gnu89 0-reset_to_98.c -o reset_to_98
./reset_to_98
```

## Tasks

Heres is a brief description of each task in this directory:
1. 0-reset_to_98.c: A function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
2. 1-swap.c: A function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. 2-strlen.c: A function that returns the length of a string.
4.
