# Static Libraries

They are Object files that are linked into a program at compile time.
The code and data from the library is copied into the program's executable file.
The library itself is not needed at runtime.

## Advantages

They can improve the performance of a program by reducing the number of external dependencies.
They can make a program more portable by ensuring that all of the necessary code and data is included in the executable file.
They create reusable code libraries that can be shared by multiple programs.

## Disadvantages

They can make a program larger and more complex.
Any changes to the static library will require the program to be recompiled.
